## talks
this is a listing of the various talks on game-based learning that i have given once or more. (17 as of mid-2022)

all illustrations are in an external 'google slide' show, into which i've copied a representative slide from each of the talks listed.

the list of talks can be filtered by a selection of topics using && or || logic
